Get up and running with this Stripe API Postman collection

1. Import the Postman collection through either of the 2 methods specified below.
* Import the latest version [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/ae1def598cfe7f2c5d67)

2. This collection takes advantage of Postman [variables and environments](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/variables-and-environments/variables/#understanding-variables-and-environments) to store/access your Stripe secret key and commonly used Stripe object IDs.

* **secret_key** - Your Stripe secret API key. Found by navigating to [Developers > API](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) on the left-hand side of the Stripe Dashboard.
* **customer_id** - Stripe [Customer object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers). Used when creating recurring subscriptions, charging an existing customer, listing charges for an existing customer, etc.
* **connect_account_id** - Stripe [Account object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/accounts). Used with Stripe's [Connect product](https://stripe.com/docs/connect).

3. Make an API Request! Make sure your Stripe Environment is active and your variable definitions match those listed above.
